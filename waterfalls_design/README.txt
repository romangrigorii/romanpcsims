Waterfalls 1:

Has circlular Rxs that are 1.4mm in radius. The design has long Ix design to accomodate visual requirements and improve touch accuracy.
Hx are ganged. Hx is 3.5mm in width.

Waterfalls 2:

Has rectangular Rxs that are 1.4 x 2.8 mm. The design has long Ix. Hx are ganged.
Hx is 3.5mm in width.

Waterfalls 3:

Has square Rxs that 2.8mm on each side. The Hx is not ganged. Hx are 3.5 mm in width. 

Waterfalls 4:

Has square Rxs that 2.8mm on each side. The Hx is not ganged. Hx are 3.5 mm in width. Utilizes neighboring island approach.

Waterfalls 6:

Has square Rxs that 2.8mm on each side. The Hx is not ganged. Hx are 3.5 mm in width. Utilizes fishbone design.


Waterfalls 8:

Distec panel, has rectangular Rxs 2mm on short side, 4mm on long side. Hx are 4.645 in width. 

Wateerfalls 9:

Innolux panel, ganged design. Rxs are 3x2mm. Uses long Ix (5.39*3/2mm long)

Wayerfalls 10:

Innolux panel, non-ganged design. Rxs are 4x2mm. uses 5.39mm long Ix. 

Waterfalls 11:

Innolux non-ganged fishbone design. 

Waterfalls 12:

Slanted Ix design

Waterfalls 13: 

Straight Ix design

Waterfalls 14:

Pinstripe design v1 no quasi islands, ellipitcal rx nodes. This is a test version of interporlation which can be applied on the island geometry level.

Waterfalls 15: 

Railraod design with quasi islands, square rx nodes. 

Waterfals 16:

Pinstripe design v2 with shorter ix and quasi islands to fill the space. 

Waterfalls 17:

Slider design v1 with Rx nodes varying their position along Hx length.

Waterfalls 18:

Pinstripe design like in Waterfalls 14, but there are guard rings around Rx. This is test design to elucidate whether having rings helps reduce Rx self cap. 

Waterfalls 19:

Slider design v2 that has quasi islands. This slider design doesn't have the strange variations in Rx positions.

Waterfalls 20:

Pinstripe design v3. Has quasi islands. Has "dead" areas that are not covered by the islands - which is its ultimate issue.

Waterfalls 21:

Slider design v3 that has quasi islands. This design is inspired by Waterfalls 17 but imporves some apsects and adds quasi isllands.
